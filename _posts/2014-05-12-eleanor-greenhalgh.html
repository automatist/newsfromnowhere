Consentsus is a research project which relates emerging feminist practices of sexual consent to democratic decision-making more widely. Asking how we might move beyond the slogan "yes means yes", the project reveals the ways that "yes" and "no" are produced by the way questions are asked, and explores how we might encode a more radically collaborative model of consent in our digital and social tools.
