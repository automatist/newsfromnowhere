21:30 - 22:00 Performance They Touched Beyoncé directed by Dennis van Vreden [V2_]

The lecture performance, An Anthem to Open Borders inspired by the specific context of the former Yugoslavia, and the phenomenon of social behavior on YouTube, which has developed to the point where pop music videos serve as monuments. The topic invites us to consider the more general theme of memory politics in the post-broadcast age.
They Touched Beyoncé is an ongoing series of performances, rehearsals and video pieces. With performers Claire van Lubeek [NL], Rita Vilhena [PT], Lesley Quist [NL], Jim van Geel [NL], Anna-Eva [NL], Piet Langeveld [NL]. [see below for the exact dates and times of the other performances.] w: http://dennisvanvreden.nl/

The participants of The Master Fine Art graduate Jasper Griepink’s Laya Papaya’s Public Bathhouse will perform in a public body meditation. In this meditation the participants will make an experiential journey while their bodies remain silent and motionless for a chosen period of time in which they are insulated in a glove of clay, mud and flowers, re-affirming the physical outlines of their bodies.
To sign up as a participant send an email to Layapapayaspublicbath@gmail.com.

organisations, locations, and trading networks that play a role in the production of military drone technologies.
